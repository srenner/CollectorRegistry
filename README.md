# CollectorRegistry

Multi tenant automotive registry site using Blazor WebAssembly and SQL Server. Influenced by my own previous [SVO Registry](http://www.svoregistry.com) project.

The app is developed with rare collector cars in mind, but the registry can also be used to host other collectibles. The primary requirement for a registry site is to have items with unique serial numbers, such as a car VIN, or a numbered limited edition vinyl record, etc. The registry is particularly useful to check the ownership history of a specific item you are looking to buy.
